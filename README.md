## How It Works

### Promotion Process
1. HR or managers initiate the promotion process based on employee performance, achievements, or tenure.
2. The module automatically updates the employee's:
   - Job title
   - Salary
   - Department or manager (if applicable)
   - Other related information, such as job grade or access rights
3. The promotion is reflected across the company’s records, ensuring consistency.

### Demotion Process
1. If an employee is demoted due to performance issues or organizational restructuring, HR can initiate the demotion process.
2. The module updates the employee's:
   - Job title
   - Salary
   - Department or manager
   - Other related information, as necessary
3. The demotion is recorded, and the employee’s job history is updated accordingly.

### Multi-Company Functionality
- The module supports companies with multiple branches or subsidiaries. Each company can manage its own promotion and demotion criteria while ensuring consistent policies across the organization.
- The promotion and demotion actions can be restricted to specific companies or departments, based on user access rights.
